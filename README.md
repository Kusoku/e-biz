Student servlet project about building an aquarium
not a real buisness project

Adaptation of one of my older servlet projects for current purposes (used few old code files), found some freeware template, and made the main builder on the project. 

The account part is not finished, if someone is interested in the code from this, feel free to use it (thought there are surely better projects).


Possible improvements: 
- new template, compatibile with bootstrap
- finishing the accounts for the page
- whatever else comes to mind
